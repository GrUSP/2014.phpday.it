				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This tutorial will drive you inside PHP&#8217;s extension system.<br />
Under Linux, we&#8217;ll present PHP and its ecosystem, try to understand how it works then move to extensions.<br />
After foreseeing existing extensions, and theoretical concepts, we&#8217;ll start by making our own.<br />
We&#8217;ll learn how to enhance the language by adding functions, constants, INI options, classes, play with streams or change the engine behavior.<br />
There will be a main exercise shown as a workshop.<br />
The final goal is that you have an accurate idea on how extensions work, and you can create at least a full skeleton of a PHP extension.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHP was added to the languages offered by Google App Engine about a year ago. This session will focus on porting an existing app on gae.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start talking about the main characteristics of the app engine platform, which kind of services are available (persistence, storage, queue and so on) and how to use it. Then the PHP installation of app engine will be discussed, highlighting implementation choices and limitations.</p>
<p>The second part of the talk will go into implementation details in particular about what tweaks are needed to run an existing app on gae e.g: how session is managed, logging is performed and how to interact with the file system not forgetting about deploy</p>

<p>This talk will take that inspection a step further and look under the hood of PHP, at the C internals, for common performance problems.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to know exactly what your code is doing, and why ++$i is faster than $i++, this talk is for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1994, the Gang of Four changed the world with their book, Design Patterns. Yet nearly 20 years later, we&#8217;re still struggling with design patterns. How can this be?</p>
<p>The answer is that design patterns are hard. Designing reusable applications is the most challenging thing a developer can do. But there&#8217;s good news: you CAN master design patterns and use them to your advantage! This workshop will show you how.</p>
<p>Learn how you&#8217;re already using design patterns in your own code, how to identify design patterns in the code of others, how to use eight of the most common design patterns (with live coding demonstrations!) and the ways in which design patterns can change your applications!</p>
